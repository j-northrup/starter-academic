My interests are in large ungulates and large freshwater fish species.
I worked on population reconstruction of white-tailed deer in Ontario using age-at-harvest hunter data for my BSc honours project.
I'm currently working as a fisheries research technician at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
