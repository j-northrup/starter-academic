My name is Shilah LeFeuvre. I have graduated from Environmental Technician at Georgian College as well as Fish and Wildlife from Fleming College. I was primarily focused on lab based work after graduating Environmental Technician regarding waste water treatment systems/hydrogeology, but wanted to get more in depth with conservation management. I am going to be entering my first year of my undergraduate studies for Conservation Biology at Trent University in the fall of 2019. I plan to continue into my Masters after. I was primarily focused on getting into fish and aquatic research at the start of my journey at Fleming College, but have taken a huge interest and passion for large mammal based research, primarily black bears and wolves. I want to further get into DNA and genetics based research regarding large mammal management and conservation. I further want to understand and base my research on how much influence anthropogenic changes to landscape have on genetic shifting and behavioral changes such as habitat selection, diet composition and reproduction. I also have an interest in studying disease and cells in large mammals, performing necropsyâ€™s, and I love lab based work- including writing reports!
