### About

I am broadly interested in the use of statistics and GIS for the analysis and communication of landscape-level questions in ecology and conservation. I am passionate about the interaction between science and environmental decisions, specifically how research projects can better incorporate policy issues and plans for sharing information with stakeholders. My research deals with the development of evidence-based recommendations for moose tag quotas based on analyses of moose population changes and hunter success rates in Ontarioâ€™s Wildlife Management Units.
