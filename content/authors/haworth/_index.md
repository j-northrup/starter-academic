My research is focusing on (1) determining the genetic demographic history and (2) defining the genetic variants at the prion protein gene (PRNP gene) in the context of chronic wasting disease (CWD) of white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) in Ontario. Co-supervised with [Aaron Shafer](http://www.aaronshafer.ca/).
