My research focus is on white-tailed deer ecology in Ontario. With the looming threat of chronic wasting disease on cervid populations the province needs to have a better understanding of the white-tailed deer population. My research goal is to help expand that knowledge to help with CWD response tools to mitigate the threat of an outbreak in Ontario. My proposed research will look at habitat selection and seasonal movements of white-tailed deer. In addition, it will evaluate population density determining methods across seasons and land use types in Ontario.
