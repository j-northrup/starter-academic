My research will establish a Moose Knowledge Network including First Nations, the Ontario Government, and academics to promote collaborative moose ecology research that supports multiple ways of knowing. Through the use of Indigenous Knowledge Systems, a holistic approach will address moose declines in Ontario while supporting cultural and spiritual traditions of Magnetawan First Nation. This research is co-supervised by [Dr. J. Popp](http://www.wiselab.ca/) (University of Guelph). Prior to graduate school, I received my B.Envs.St. from the University of Manitoba where my undergraduate research assessed the presence of brainworm throughout Riding Mountain National Park.
