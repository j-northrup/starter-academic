My research focus is on understanding how predator species rely on navigation when searching for prey. Specifically, I am interested in how wolves use navigation to achieve similar kill rates in territories of high and low prey density. I am using a dataset of GPS radio collared wolves in Ontarioâ€™s northern boreal forest to assess how characteristics of prey searching behavior and movement strategy change across gradients of prey density. The goal of my research is to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the navigational capacity of species.
