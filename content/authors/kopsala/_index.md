My research revolves around the use of DNA to study wildlife populations. Presently, I am studying black bears within Ontario. The goals of my current research are twofold: (1) - to determine whether existing genetic structure within the Ontario black bear population has a functional component, and (2) - to assess gene flow directionality in different areas of Ontario, and what drives this process. Co-supervised with Dr. Christoper Kyle.
