My research interests revolve around wildlife genetics, specifically population genetics. Currently, I am using a pooled sequencing approach to study the functional genetic landscape of black bears (*Ursus americanus*) within Ontario as it relates to different forest regions and climate zones. Co-supervised with Chris Kyle.
