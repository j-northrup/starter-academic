The focus of this research is to understnad how natural gas development influences the behavior and population dynamics of mule deer. Natural gas development increased rapidly throughout western North America through the 2000s. This development brough with it substantial land-use change that has the potential to impact a range of wildlife species. This project is a large collaboration lead by Chuck Anderson at Colorado Parks and Wildlife and in conjunction with [George Wittemyer](https://sites.warnercnr.colostate.edu/georgewittemyer/) at Colorado State University.
