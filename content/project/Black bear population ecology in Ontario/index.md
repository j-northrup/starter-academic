title: Black bear population ecology in Ontario

---


This project is focused on understanding what factors influence variation in black bear population density across the province of Ontario. We are using non-invasive sampling and spatial capture-recapture models to estimate black bear population density and relate variation in density to factors such as harvest, habitat fragmentation and climate. The results of this work will have direct implications for informing sustainable management of bears in the province and for understanding the natural and anthropogenic factors influencing bera populations.
